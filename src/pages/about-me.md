Hi, I’m Travis James — part **creative powerhouse**, part spreadsheet sorcerer, and 100% chaos with a cause. I’m the kind of person who can build a **brand strategy** in the morning, troubleshoot your **WordPress** theme at lunch, and have a philosophical debate about **psychology** by dinner — all while planning my next road trip with my demon dog, Captain, riding shotgun. **I thrive at the intersection of structure and spontaneity**, where big ideas meet bullet points, and I never met a project I couldn’t turn into something extraordinary (or at least wildly efficient).

I’m a big believer in balance — work hard, play harder, and laugh hardest. Whether I’m wrangling workflows, deep diving into behavior theory, or renovating an RV with zero prior experience and a YouTube tutorial, **I do it with heart, humor, and high standards.** I don’t just show up — I arrive. My vibe? **Bold but grounded.** Tech-savvy but people-first. A little sparkle, a little sass, and a whole lot of get-it-done energy. Stick around — it only gets more fun from here.

## My Beginnings 👶

I was born with curiosity in my DNA and a natural knack for leadership and creativity. Growing up, I always found myself stepping into roles where I could bring people together, solve problems, or spark ideas — whether that was in the classroom, school clubs, or community activities. In high school, I was deep into marching band and proud to be part of the Florida Bandmasters Association. I challenged myself with all honors classes and participated in AVID, fueling my drive to learn and push beyond the expected. I graduated with a solid 3.52 GPA, a testament to my dedication and work ethic. These experiences laid the foundation for my passion to learn, adapt, and create — an energy that followed me through graduation and beyond.

I didn’t jump straight into college but dove headfirst into the workforce, letting real-world experience be my classroom. And honestly? That choice taught me more about people, systems, and hustle than any textbook ever could.

## My Work Experiences 💼

I’ve had a wildly diverse career path, from managing tactical laser tag battles to guiding students in higher education. My journey started as a Manager at Laser Tactics, where I balanced customer service with operational logistics and event planning. Then came roles at Best Buy and Apple, where I leveled up my tech knowledge, helping people solve problems, choose the right devices, and understand their tools better. At Apple, I served as both a Product and Technical Specialist, blending product expertise with problem-solving finesse.

As a Department Supervisor at The Villages Golf Cars, I led the delivery team and optimized fulfillment processes. From there, I joined Universal Parks & Resorts as a Special Services Team Lead, managing guest relations and providing phone-based support during high-volume seasons. At Disney World, I was an Attractions Host, where I made the magic happen for guests every day. My leadership continued to grow at Target, where I served as an Assets Protection Team Leader (APTL) — and later at Nike, where I worked as an Athlete Services Coach and trainer. Most recently, I’ve brought it all together in higher ed as a Program Associate at Salt Lake Community College, where I support students on their academic journey.

## My Educational Journey 🎓

After gaining years of valuable real-world experience, I returned to school and graduated from Colorado Technical University with Highest Honors, earning my Associate of Science in Business Administration and a 3.82 GPA. My passion for learning didn’t stop there — I’m now pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, where I plan to combine my real-world insights with academic training to better understand behavior, motivation, and human development.

Education for me is not just about credentials — it’s about curiosity, empowerment, and making an impact. My journey proves it’s never too late to learn something new, shift directions, or level up your goals.

## Professional Certifications 📜

I’m a Microsoft Office Expert certified in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, SharePoint, and Access, with a sharp edge in digital productivity. I’m also an Adobe Certified Professional with experience in Photoshop and Dreamweaver, blending creativity and design with functional usability.

## Hobbies 🚀

When I’m not hustling through work or hitting the books, I’m diving headfirst into everything that makes life interesting. My hobbies aren’t just ways to pass the time — they’re the fuel that keeps my curiosity blazing and my energy unstoppable. From hands-on projects to wild adventures with my four-legged sidekick, these passions shape who I am and keep me charging full speed ahead.

### Unconventional Learning 🧠

Listen, I don’t do boring. My education happens in the trenches — like when I’m elbow-deep in RV renovation, turning a rusty old beast into a rolling masterpiece. I’m talking wiring, carpentry, and duct tape wizardry that would make a handyman jealous. Camping? That’s my “school of survival” where I master patience, problem-solving, and the fine art of not losing my sanity when the weather throws a tantrum.

Tech is my playground — I’m constantly hacking away at WordPress, taming CMS beasts, and geeking out over the latest software that helps me work smarter, not harder. Toss in a heavy dose of psychology research and a curiosity that won’t quit, and you’ve got someone who’s always learning, always growing, and never afraid to get their hands dirty. Because real growth? It’s messy, unpredictable, and totally worth it.

### Things I Enjoy 🎉

When I’m not being a professional problem solver, I’m out chasing adventure and soaking up life like it’s a fine cocktail. I’ve hit up the Bahamas and Mexico so many times I’m practically a VIP—fluent in beach vibes and tequila shots. I’ve also racked up road trip miles across 20 states, collecting stories and souvenirs (mostly snacks).

And then there’s Captain — my four-legged hellhound who’s part Border Collie, part mischief, and 100% my partner in crime. He keeps me on my toes, tests my patience, and somehow manages to be adorable enough to get away with it all. Whether I’m under the stars camping, snapping photos, or just kicking back with friends, I’m all about living big, laughing loud, and loving every minute of the ride.

## Plans for the Future 🔮

Looking ahead, I’m deeply committed to continuing my education and personal growth. My current focus is on completing my Bachelor of Science in Psychology, but I’m already setting my sights higher — aiming to pursue a PhD or PsyD in psychology with a specialization in developmental or educational psychology. I’m fascinated by how people learn, grow, and overcome challenges throughout their lives, and I want to be at the forefront of creating supportive environments that foster success and well-being.

Beyond academics, I see myself bridging my passion for psychology, technology, and design to develop innovative tools and programs that empower students, educators, and professionals. Whether it’s through building digital platforms for learning, mentoring others, or leading initiatives that promote equity and inclusion, I want my work to create real impact. Ultimately, I aspire to be a catalyst for positive change — helping people unlock their potential, navigate life’s complexities, and find purpose in both personal and professional spheres.



I'm **Travis James Hornbuckle**, and I thank you for reading this.
