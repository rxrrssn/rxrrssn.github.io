## üå§Ô∏è Abstract
Digital environments are now central to LGBTQIA+ self-concept, serving as both spaces of affirmation and sites of alienation.  
This project synthesizes interdisciplinary research across psychology, sociology, and media studies to explore how online life both strengthens and fragments queer identity.  
The goal is to highlight how digital ecosystems amplify connection while perpetuating isolation, forming what this study calls the **affirmation‚Äìalienation paradox**.
