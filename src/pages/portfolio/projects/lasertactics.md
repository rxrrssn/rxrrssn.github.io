The **Shortage Action Plan (SAP)** app at **Target** is a mobile tool designed to help store teams identify, track, and resolve product shortage issues. It provides real-time data on high-shrink items and guides team members through actionable steps to reduce loss and improve inventory accuracy. Through SAP, leaders can assign tasks, monitor progress, and implement targeted prevention strategies by department or product category. By combining analytics with on-the-floor accountability, the app plays a key role in minimizing shortage, supporting operational efficiency, and protecting the store’s profitability.
